                    <p><strong>This is the digital age.</strong> It brings its own challenges, not least the skills needed to survive and get ahead in the modern workplace.
                    <p>Demand for digitally competent professionals across all economic sectors <em>continues to grow</em> and is outstripping supply.</p>
                    <p>As a sector, <code>ICT</code> is growing rapidly and creating about 120,000 new jobs each year. But due to differences in demands and skills, and despite high unemployment - especially among the young â€“ Europe could face a shortage of up to 900,000 skilled ICT workers by 2020.</p>
